# Code for Boulder

>The source code for Code for Boulder's website: http://www.codeforboulder.org/

## Project details

Currently, we have a squarespace website hosted [here](http://www.codeforboulder.org/), and we would like to transition to our own React site.

This project has been updated periodically for some time now, and consequently includes React code from a few different eras. Components are stored in their own folder - with the default export file and the corresponding stylesheet.

## Getting started

Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Next, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/C4B.org.git
```
`cd` into the repo:
```
cd C4B.org
```
and install the project dependencies by running
```
npm install
```

## Contributing

### 1. Find an Issue Pending Development, Needing Help, or Asking a Question

Want to develop? All issues that have been approved for development, but have not been started will be labelled as **Status: Pending**.

We'd love your input on possible new features. Some issues aren't ready for development and won't have a status label. These issues may need more input before being approved and instead be labelled **Type: Help Wanted**.

Maybe you have the answer to someone's question. Look through any issues labelled with **Type: Help Wanted** and comment with your answer.

### 2. Work on an Issue

Once you have have found an issue you feel comfortable working on, request to work on the issue and we'll label the issue as **Status: In Progress** to make sure others don't work on it as well.

Then, create a new branch off the current `master`.

### 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once you believe your feature is ready for production, create a PR and reference what issue this addresses in the PR's description.

If there any updates requested, please make those updates on your local branch and re-push that branch to the repository.

If approved, project managers will handle merging and deploying.
